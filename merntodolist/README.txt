HELLO WEB DEV TEAM!!

This "MERN" todo list challenge uses MongoDB/React/Express.js/Node.js.

The user has the ability to:

Add a new todo to the list (todo will be stored in database)
Delete any todo from the list and database
Check off any todo to mark it as completed


To start the app you will need to download the node_modules into the client folder. (Run npm install in terminal in the client folder)  

Then you can start the server and the React app in one of two ways:

1. Run mongod in one terminal in the merntodolist folder, run nodemon or node server.js in a second terminal in the merntodolist folder and then npm start in a third terminal in the client folder.

OR

2. Run mongod in one terminal in the merntodolist folder and then npm run dev in a second terminal in the merntodolist folder (to run both the server and the React app at the same time.
